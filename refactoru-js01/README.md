js basics

Requirements
a. Hello Boulder

Create a blank, valid html5 document.
Create a javascript file with the content alert('Hello Boulder!'); and include it in your page with the script tag.
Check Yo Self:When you refresh the page, you should see an annoying alert box that interrupts with the message, "Hello Boulder!".

b. Personal Hello

Create a blank, valid html5 document.
Create a javascript file and include it with a script tag as before.
Use var, prompt, string literals, the + operator, and alert such that when the user opens the page, it will ask them for their name, and then respond with "Hello [YOUR_NAME]!"
