css modularity 1

Requirements
Write the CSS necessary to render the following components (see screenshots below). Use the given starter code.
data table
stats
bar chart
lightbox
media block
Important: Do not modify the HTML other than to add ids and classes.
Your CSS must meet the following requirements:
Must work on different types of elements (not dependent on tagname)
Must not affect other elements of the same type
Must work in nested hierarchies (e.g. a list within a list; styles should not break)
Must not be location specific (can be applied to similar elements on different pages/sections of the site)
Style the given HTML to match the following screenshot. It doesn't need to be pixel perfect (just eyeball it) but it should be close, with color, font, layout, and spacing properly accounted for.
