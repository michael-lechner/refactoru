=============

Problem Set #3
Write a function palindrome that takes a single string parameter and returns true if the parameter is a palindrome
(the string is the same forward as it is backward), otherwise returns false. For example: palindrome("racecar") 
should return true because "racecar" is also "racecar" backwards.

Write a function dashInsert that takes a single num parameter and returns the num with inserted dashes ('-') 
between adjacent odd digits. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be "4547-9-3".

Bonus:
Write a function caesarCipher that takes a string and number parameter and performs a Caesar Cipher 
shift on it using the num parameter as the shifting number. A Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter 
in the string N places down in the alphabet (in this case N will be num). Punctuation, spaces, and capitalization 
should remain intact. For example if the string is "Caesar Cipher" and num is 2 the output should be "Ecguct Ekrjgt".
